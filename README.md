# REACT WITH REDUX:

## Description


_Duration: 2 days_

In this project, I was presented with the task of creating an APP which would allow users
to generate feedback.  That data gets posted to a server, and an ADMIN can later manipulate
the database to see all feedback, and delete entries.

I solved this problem by using some tools to help Redirect the user through the experience, and then gave them a funny walking tomato to look at for submitting their feedback.

I'm proud of how I handled the form to handle user feedback rating.  I made this into a reusable component and this style of programming will lead to larger scalability.


### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `prime_feedback`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage
How does someone use this application? Tell a user story here.

1. User starts application up and is asked to Submit feedback && don't forget it.
2. Choose your ratings throughout and feel free to leave comments!
3. After reviewing your submission, complete the feedback loop by clicking on SUBMIT FEEDBACK.
4. Enjoy your walking Tomato!

## Built With

React
React-Redux
Nodemon
Node
Express
Javascript
SQL

## Future Outlook

1. Implement the deletion of feedback from the database.
2. Allow user to modify feedback and return to previous pages.
3. Allow ADMIN to see all feedback.
4. Practice my SASS skills.
